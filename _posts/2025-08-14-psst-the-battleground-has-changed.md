We all know competition in business is fierce. No one needs to tell you that. Everywhere, companies compete based on product, technology, price and the carcasses of failed businesses are everywhere...

"About half of all new establishments survive five years or more and about one-third survive 10 years or more. As one would expect, the probability of survival increases with a firm’s age. Survival rates have changed little over time.”

#### Blah blah. Have a look at this graph…


Very sobering.  It is tremendously difficult to not only survive but also operate a successful business in  today’s competitive environment.

However, there is one way some companies are winning the battle - It is an old-fashioned way, but it works: Be good to your customers. Really, really good. Aim to exceed the expectations of your customers right from their first encounter to years after they’ve become your loyal, return customer. Jerry Gregoire former CIO of Dell and Pepsi says “The customer experience is the next competitive battleground.”  

Psst this isn’t a secret. Gartner has done some research Gartner – 2014 – Gartner Survey Finds Importance of Customer Experience on the Rise — Marketing Is on the Hook (n=200 responsible for customer experience, revenue > $500M) and found...

“89% of companies surveyed plan to compete primarily on the basis of the customer experience by 2016 “

“Sounds great.  But we don’t have $500M in revenue.  What can we do?” Firstly Make 2016 - “Year of the Customer” Secondly as a company be committed to the process of becoming a customer-centric business. Thirdly, start small… Amazon has cultivated 5 customer experience habits that have produced some amazing success (I think they are a great start). They are...

- Listen to what customers value and seek their feedback on their experiences.
- Think objectively to make sound, fact-based decisions.
- Empower employees with the resources they need to please customers.
- Create new value for customers, without being asked.
- Delight customers by exceeding their expectations.
- Design one project (just one) that will embody one of these habits, implement and review results.. repeat. Start your company’s journey in Customer Experience today.
